# Deploying a sample project in Sigma

In sigma, you don't necessarily have to start a project from scratch. You may start by openning an existing project from your own Github account, or by openning a public project from someone else's github account.

Inorder to make things more convinient for you, SLAppforge has provided you some sample projects covering almost all the [resources](concepts/resources.md) supported by Sigma.

You can select and open a sample project from the Project View of the IDE. There are two ways to open the Project View of Sigma.

1. At startup, after successfully loging in.
