# What is SLAppForge Sigma?

Sigma IDE enables you to develop Serverless applications simply by dragging and
dropping components on to the pane. The editor provides the best of both worlds
by allowing a user to edit the code using Sigma's rich text editor and also
the ease of drag and drop elements.

To start development, a user needs valid AWS credentials and a GitHub account.
As the first step a user will need to create an account with Sigma. Upon login,
the user will be requested to provide his/her AWS credentials. You will then
need to provide your GitHub credentials to login.

The user will be shown the following view upon login.

Sigma IDE makes lambda function development easier by centralizing resource/ trigger
configurations and the application logic. Rather than navigating through AWS services
to configure each trigger/ resource, a simple drag and drop can configure all of the
components required.
