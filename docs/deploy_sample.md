# Deploying a sample project in Sigma

In sigma, you don't necessarily have to start a project from scratch.
You may start by opening an existing project from your own GitHub account, or by opening a public project from someone else's GitHub account.

In order to make things more convenient for you, SLAppforge has provided you some sample projects covering almost all the [resources](concepts/resources.md) supported by Sigma.

You can select and open a sample project from the Project View of the IDE. There are two ways to open the Project View of Sigma.

1. At startup, after successfully logging in.
